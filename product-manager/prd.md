### 1. Introduction & Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the initial public-facing website for **Knowlance AI Private Limited**. This website will serve as the primary digital storefront, lead generation engine, and community hub for the company.

The core purpose of this project is to create a modern, aesthetic, and trustworthy online presence that effectively communicates our **Unique Value Proposition (UVP): "Custom AI, Built Fast."** The site will not only showcase our services but also provide a direct channel for potential clients to submit their project needs (the "Client Console") and engage with our team and the broader AI community.

This PRD is intended for designers, developers, and marketing stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the project goals and scope.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary business goals for the V1.0 website are:

*   **Generate Qualified Leads:** To be the primary channel for acquiring new clients by encouraging demo requests through a streamlined client console.
*   **Establish Brand Credibility & Trust:** To build confidence in our capabilities by showcasing our expert team, our development philosophy, and our thought leadership.
*   **Build an Engaged Community:** To create a "community moat" by fostering a space for discussion on AI trends, which will serve as a long-term marketing and feedback channel.
*   **Validate Market Interest:** To gauge interest in our upcoming MVP, the "AI Data Analyst," and build a pre-launch waitlist.

### 3. Target Audience & User Personas

The website must be designed to serve three primary user personas:

1.  **Alex Chen (The Pragmatic Decision-Maker):** A non-technical business leader who needs a fast, reliable AI solution to a specific business problem. He values trust, clarity, and a clear path to ROI. **His primary journey is to understand our service and request a demo.**
2.  **Priya Sharma (The Technical Evaluator):** A CTO or tech lead who needs to validate our technical expertise before outsourcing a project. She values deep technical information, team credentials, and evidence of capability. **Her primary journey is to vet the engineering team and understand our process.**
3.  **Ben Carter (The Aspiring Community Member):** A student or AI enthusiast who wants to learn from professionals and engage with the latest AI trends. He is a future brand evangelist and potential talent. **His primary journey is to join the community and follow our work.**
